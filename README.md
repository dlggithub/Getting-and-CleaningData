The following assignment data was collected from:

 After which I produced script to do the following tasks completing the required assignment.

	1	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

	2	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 		measurement.

	3	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

	4	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

	5	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 		of each variable for each activity and each subject ending with final file "tidy.txt".
